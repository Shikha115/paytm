# PayM-like Application

## Step 1 - What are we building?

We are building a **PayM-like application** that lets users send money to each other, starting with an initial dummy balance. This project is part of the **100xDev Course** by Harkirat Singh.


### Clone the Starter Repository

To begin, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shikha115/paytm.git


This will give you the initial structure of the application to start building the features.
